Y =Xβ+e

##Applications
Applications often fall into two special cases: Regression Analysis and Analy- sis of Variance. Regression Analysis refers to models in which the matrix X′X is nonsingular. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) models are models in which the model matrix consists entirely of zeros and ones. ANOVA models are sometimes called classification models.

Cov(AY +b) = ACov(Y)A′.
This last equality can be used to show that for any random vector Y, Cov(Y) is nonnegative definite. It follows that Y is nonsingular if and only if Cov(Y ) is positive definite.

If Y ∼ N(μ,V)
by definition we can write Y ∼ AZ + μ , where A is an r × n matrix.
