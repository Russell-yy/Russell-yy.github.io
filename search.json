Foods great, life simple. And the courses seem to be easy for me in the first week.<br><br>However, things become weird from the second week – I took off in a rocket! Dr. Pressier presumed that we all knew the GLM, and he speeded up from one slide to another and covered many calculations without details. Apart, Dr. Li allocated tons of reading material for us to read – also a real challenge for me.<br><br>Thanks to Hurricane Florence, we have a holiday from September 12 to September 16. Without this period of time, it seems that I can not catch up with the class. Thank god!<br><br>One thing to mention, I have not developed an exercise routine here. Simply put, I am always reluctant to go to the gym. Maybe I will join the Ballroom Dance in the following days. </font>\n\n\n","categories":["essay"],"tags":[]},{"title":"菜谱","url":"http://russell-yy.github.io/2018/08/13/菜谱/","content":"<p>#<br>煎牛排<br>将冰箱里的牛排取出，先化冻，再切成合适大小，备用。<br>橄榄油若干倒入锅中，预热，再加入牛排。<br>煎牛排时用中火，每一面煎15-20秒后立即翻面。观察牛排颜色，根据自己的喜好安排煎的时间。</p>\n<p>#<br>烤鸡胸肉<br>鸡胸肉用橄榄油、盐、黑胡椒粉、料酒、蒜泥腌30分钟，之后放入烤箱设定390华氏摄氏度烤30分钟。</p>\n","categories":["essay"],"tags":[]},{"title":"about","url":"http://russell-yy.github.io/about/index.html","content":"","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"category","url":"http://russell-yy.github.io/category/index.html","content":"","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"search","url":"http://russell-yy.github.io/search/index.html","content":"","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"tag","url":"http://russell-yy.github.io/tag/index.html","content":"","categories":[],"tags":[]}]
